This is a Rust project.

The script ./scripts/aittributor is a convenience script that compiles and executes aittributor. ALWAYS use this to run, NEVER manually compile and run.

We use:
- Hermit to manage toolchains and tools.
- Just for command running.

Use the libraries already added in @Cargo.toml.

@README.md describes the design of this command-line tool.

ALWAYS keep the README up to date with features.
